    <h2>Communications From Persifund</h2>
    <p>
      To improve our products and services we may ask merchants and customers to
      complete surveys that We use for research purposes, although they do not
      have to respond to them. We may periodically send merchants and customers
      information regarding the Persifund APP and our services, updates,
      promotional emails, new products, special offers, or other information
      which We think they may find interesting. The information may be sent to
      merchants and customers via email, push notifications, text, internal
      messaging, and/or another form of notification system. In such cases, We
      will use the email address or other contact information provided to Us by
      them.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We May Collect From Merchant And Customer</h2>
    <p>
      Each merchant and customer agrees that Persifund may collect the following
      information about them: Name, contact information, purchasing information,
      including email address, phone number, age, gender, IP (Internet Protocol)
      address, physical address, information supplied during the processing of
      registering with Us, data usage trends, data showing the effectiveness of
      promotional campaigns, browser information, demographic information,
      browsing preferences, browsing data, the type of device being used,
      website usage information, information regarding any URLs used with the
      services, data regarding use of the Persifund APP and our services, other
      information relevant to surveys and/or offers, and any other information
      We are legally allowed to collect. We require this information to provide
      merchants and customers with better services.
    </p>

    <h2>Heat Map And Tracking Software </h2>
    <p>
      We may use various types of website tracking software (“Tracking
      Software”) to track mouse movement, scrolling, and clicks on Our website
      in order to better understand Our users&apos; needs and to optimize the
      use of the Persifund APP and our services. The most common form of
      tracking software is referred to as a “heat map” and the forms of heat
      maps include scroll maps, click maps, and movement maps. Heat maps are
      graphical representations of data where values are depicted by color.
      Merchants and customers specifically agree to Our use of tracking software
      and heat maps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our tracking software may capture screen shots of a visitor&apos;s mouse
      movements, scrolling, and clicking habits which helps us understand what
      visitors want, care about, and do on our website by visually representing
      their clicks, taps and scrolling behavior. Some of the reasons why We use
      heat map software are as follows: to see if visitors are reaching
      important content or failing to see it, to find and use a page&apos;s main
      links, buttons, opt-ins, and CTAs, to see if visitors are getting
      distracted by non-clickable elements, and to compare usage against mobile,
      tablet and desktop devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use tracking software to help us better understand our visitors&apos;
      experience (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links
      they choose to click, what visitors do and don&apos;t like, etc.) and this
      enables us to build and maintain our services with important feedback.
      This traffic software uses cookies and other technologies to collect data
      on our visitors&apos; behavior and their devices. This includes a
      device&apos;s IP address (processed during visitors&apos; website visits
      and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type
      (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location
      (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website.
      This tracking software stores this information on our behalf in a
      pseudonymized visitor profile. The company We obtained this tracking
      software from is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected
      on our behalf.
    </p>

      with vendors, business clients, and other third-party providers who are
